## Dumbledore

Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.

## 关于反派

所有以个人（少数）意志定义的秩序纲领都是自欺欺人的傲慢无知；在大尺度上没有一个人更靠近“终极意义”和“长远利益”，都是yy。 眼下能做的，就是尊重生命尊重个体，尊重每一个个体的权利，相信生命本身。所以X教授才是真的精神领袖，一个人真正伟大之处就在于不以自己的意志轻易褫夺别人的权利。
