The result is, Chinese is compatible here, but very very very ugly.

## Dumbledore - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.

Yep, double, not bug.

## 关于反派

所有以个人（少数）意志定义的秩序纲领都是自欺欺人的傲慢无知；在大尺度上没有一个人更靠近“终极意义”和“长远利益”，都是yy。 眼下能做的，就是尊重生命尊重个体，尊重每一个个体的权利，相信生命本身。所以X教授才是真的精神领袖，一个人真正伟大之处就在于不以自己的意志轻易褫夺别人的权利。 

这种反派往往看起来特别清新脱俗，跟那些为了一己私利的普通反派们不一样。但实际上，这种反派最傲慢、最自我中心。

但有趣的是，他们往往以为自己是最谦卑的。他们把自己想出来的“优越的秩序”看得神圣无比，自己也可以为之牺牲。

但其实这是个自大者的逻辑闭环：秩序神圣-秩序是我想出来的-我是对的-所以秩序神圣
