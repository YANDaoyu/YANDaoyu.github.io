## 002. [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)

```
You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order** and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
```

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {  
        ListNode *head = NULL, *prev = NULL;
        int carry = 0;

        while (l1 || l2) {
            int v1 = l1? l1->val: 0;
            int v2 = l2? l2->val: 0;
            int tmp = v1 + v2 + carry;
            carry = tmp / 10;
            int val = tmp % 10;


            ListNode* cur = new ListNode(val);  /* Step3: create a newcur */
            if (!head) head = cur;              /* Step1: head->next = NULL */
            if (prev) prev->next = cur;         /* Step4: cur->next = head->cur = newcur */
            prev = cur;                         /* Step2: prev = cur = head */


            l1 = l1? l1->next: NULL;
            l2 = l2? l2->next: NULL;
        }
        if (carry > 0) {
            ListNode* l = new ListNode(carry);
            prev->next = l;
        }
        return head;
    }
};
```
Forgot necessary knowledges about **structure** and **point** and **linked list**. Besides, define a function in structure as `ListNode(int x)` is very common, but the operation `new ListNode(val)` may be not necessarily. If you want to create a structure dynamic,  and be able to delete whenever you want, you should use `new`. 
Created `new` in `heap` or `stack`?  
Only have a comparable ambiguous understanding of these stuffs. qwq.


##004. [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/)

>There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size m and n respectively.
>Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

>You may assume **nums1** and **nums2** cannot be both empty.
